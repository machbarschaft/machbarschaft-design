## The Design
The Design and Logo was made by the graphic designer Hanna Burgstaller. It should show the sense of the collective, warmth and helpfulness of the neighborhood. The playful elements are in balance with the straight font and so the design looks well-adjusted.

At the moment the design is exists out of the logo and the color scheme. We got the logo in several versions, so we can use it for all purposes. For the website, for flyer, prints, on dark and light backgrounds. 
The existing versions of the logos are industry standard. There are negative, positive, black and white and the original version in several sizes. 
We also need an appropriate icon for the app, this can be found also in the files. We got here two versions, one with the lettering, one without. 

The roadmap concerning the design is all about findind
ga designer who can design the coorporate identidy also for the app and the website. So that we can ensure and constant presentation of our project to the outside. We dont want to change the logo so we will fit the comming design to the already existing logo and color scheme.

## The roadmap
 
Seamless Help without media discontinuity for older people
 
We are developing a telephone service that older people can simply call to express their needs. A bot receives the request and, with the help of artificial intelligence, creates a request which we feed into an app. In the app, there are volunteer neighbours who accept requests and take care of things - from small purchases to picking up medication or other daily chores.
„So machen wir Nachbar:innen zu Machbar:innen“
„So neighborhoods become makerhoods“
