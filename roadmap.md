Seamless Help without media discontinuity for older people
 
We are developing a telephone service that older people can simply call to express their needs. A bot receives the request and, with the help of artificial intelligence, creates a request which we feed into an app. In the app, there are volunteer neighbours who accept requests and take care of things - from small purchases to picking up medication or other daily chores.
„So machen wir Nachbar:innen zu Machbar:innen“
